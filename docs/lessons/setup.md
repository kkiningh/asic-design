In this course, we use Synopsys tools for synthesis.


Setting up the Synopsys toolchain on Corn
---

The easiest way to access the Synopsys toolchain at Stanford is through AFS.

The toolchain is located at `/afs/ir.stanford.edu/class/ee/synopsys/`

Running the tools can be done locally if you're on the Stanford network and you are running Linux.
However, since many of the Synopsys tools require very specific dependecies, it's much easier to just use them on corn.

Once you've logged into corn, you'll need to load the toolchain.

(Optional) Setting Up the Synopsys toolchain locally
---

It also be convienent to run the Synopsys toolchain locally, especially if you have a fast computer.

### Setup OpenAFS ###

To access AFS on a personal computer, install OpenAFS.

Set it up like the following:

Using open source tools
---

As another alternative, for simulation and synthesis it is also possible to use open source tools.
